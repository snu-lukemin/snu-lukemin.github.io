I am a Ph.D student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University (SNU). My main research topics are fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and multi-party computation (MPC). Especially, I specialise in enhancing the performance / functionality of a variety of FHE schemes. 

My advisor is Professor [Yongsoo Song]. I graduated Daegu Science High School (2018) and did a B.S. in Mathematics at Seoul National University (SNU). For a complete list of my publications, please refer to my [CV], or [Google Scholar].
