I am a Ph.D student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University (SNU). My advisor is Professor [Yongsoo Song]. I graduated Daegu Science High School (2018) and did a B.S. in Mathematics at Seoul National University (SNU).

My main research area is Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and its applications, such as Privacy Preserving Maching Learning (PPML) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC).
